# Interactive-Bingo-Grid
  This is a project I worked on for Struggles to Strengths, which is an Atlanta non-profit that helps families overcome trauma. I created an interactive bingo board for the holiday donation drive that would reveal to the user what their donation could provide to a family in need. This feature was built for their existing Squarespace website.
